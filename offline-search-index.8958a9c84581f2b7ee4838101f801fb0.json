[{"body":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.\n This section is where the user documentation for your project lives - all the information your users need to understand and successfully use your project.\nFor large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all of them don’t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own. You can see an example of a smaller Docsy documentation site in the Docsy User Guide, which lives in the Docsy theme repo if you’d like to copy its docs section.\nOther content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates should live in the About and Community pages.\nFind out how to use the Docsy theme in the Docsy User Guide. You can learn more about how to organize your documentation (and how we organized this site) in Organizing Your Content.\nDia ","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":" This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template …","ref":"/docs-as-code/","tags":"","title":"Documentation"},{"body":"ThoughtWorks Tech Radar https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/diagrams-as-code\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"ThoughtWorks Tech Radar …","ref":"/docs-as-code/diagrams/","tags":"","title":"Diagrams"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs-as-code/index.json","tags":"","title":""},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/docs-as-code/categories/","tags":"","title":"Categories"},{"body":"DOCS AS\nCODE  Carl Chesser @che55er | che55er.io    About Me      Guides through Drawings   Outline 🔍 Introduction 📚 History 🚀 Examples\n 📄 🧑‍💻 Docs as Code?
